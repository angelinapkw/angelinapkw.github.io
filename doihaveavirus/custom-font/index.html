        VIRAL

    <h1> SUBHEADING </h1>
    <p>biological viruses have always been a potent threat to humanity, as historic pandemics have proved. No wonder viruses became an ideal weapon model in a totally different world — a world of programming. The first computer viruses were created as early as in the 1970s. Starting as pranks, they evolved to become a major threat to the stability of computer networks worldwide. And the more I think of viruses, both biological and digital, the more amazed I am by their similarities. We don’t know what kind of challenges viruses of either type will cause in the future, but understanding how they infect, the symptoms they induce, how they spread, and the damage they can cause can help us fight both.
